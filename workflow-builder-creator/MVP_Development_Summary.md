# MVP Development Summary: Workflow Builder

This document summarizes the key architectural decisions and development steps taken to build the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Workflow Builder application.

## 1. Core Objective

The goal was to create a web-based, visually-driven workflow tool with a focus on core viewing and editing functionalities. The MVP scope was defined by six key user stories, covering data loading, canvas navigation, node interaction, connection creation, flow animation, and responsive layout.

## 2. Architectural Foundation

The project was refactored from a single-file structure into a modern, modular ES6 architecture. This was the most critical step, providing a scalable and maintainable foundation for future development.

### Key Modules:

-   **`main.js` (App Controller)**: The main entry point. Initializes all other modules, loads initial data, and manages the main render loop.
-   **`state.js` (State Manager)**: Acts as the Single Source of Truth (SSoT). Holds the application's core data (`nodes`, `connections`, `transform`). Centralizing the state makes the application predictable and easier to debug.
-   **`renderer.js` (Renderer)**: Responsible for all rendering to the SVG canvas. It takes the current state and visualizes it, decoupling rendering logic from application logic.
-   **`interaction.js` (Interaction Manager)**: Handles all user inputs, including mouse clicks, drags, and wheel events. It translates user actions into state changes (e.g., updating a node's position).
-   **`animation.js` (Animation Manager)**: Manages the logic for the "flow" animation, such as particle positions and progress. It's driven by the main render loop.
-   **`config.js` (Configuration)**: Stores static configuration data (node sizes, zoom levels, etc.), separating configuration from code.

This modular approach adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, making the codebase significantly easier to understand, test, and extend.

## 3. Key Feature Implementation

### a. Refactoring to a Modular Architecture

-   **Action**: Broke down the original monolithic `main.js` into the distinct modules listed above.
-   **Best Practice**: Using ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) allows for clear dependency management and improves code organization. This is standard practice for modern web development.

### b. Asynchronous Data Loading

-   **Action**: Implemented `fetch()` in `main.js` to load the initial workflow from a `flow.json` file.
-   **Best Practice**: Asynchronous loading prevents the UI from freezing while waiting for data. Including a `try...catch` block with a fallback to sample data makes the application more robust.

### c. Interactive Connection Creation

-   **Action**: This was a multi-step process:
    1.  **Renderer**: Dynamically added "anchor points" (`<circle>`) to each node.
    2.  **CSS**: Styled the anchor points to be hidden by default and only appear on node hover, keeping the UI clean.
    3.  **Interaction Manager**: Implemented the core logic to detect a drag starting on an anchor, draw a preview line, and create a new connection in the state upon releasing the mouse over a valid target node.
-   **Best Practice**: This feature demonstrates a clean separation of concerns: the renderer handles *how* things look, CSS handles the styling and hover interactions, and the interaction manager handles the complex logic of the user's action.

### d. Time-Based Animation

-   **Action**: Implemented a time-based animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame`. The `AnimationManager` updates particle progress based on `deltaTime` (the time elapsed since the last frame).
-   **Best Practice**: `requestAnimationFrame` is the browser's optimized way to run animations. Using `deltaTime` ensures that the animation speed is consistent across different hardware and frame rates, which is crucial for a smooth user experience.

### e. Responsive Layout

-   **Action**: Used a `ResizeObserver` to monitor the size of the canvas's parent container. When the size changes, the SVG element's `width` and `height` attributes are updated.
-   **Best Practice**: `ResizeObserver` is more performant and targeted than listening to the `window.resize` event, as it only fires when the observed element's size actually changes.

## 4. Final MVP State

The result is a robust, functional, and well-architected application that successfully fulfills all initial user stories. The clean codebase and strong architectural patterns make it well-prepared for future feature enhancements as outlined in the project's phased development plan.
